# Front_End
Good base point to develop the project from in my opinion. Clone it and check it out let me know what you think, keep some or all.

clone my branch by running this command:
git clone -b Eric-Hendrix https://github.com/bw-dad-jokes/Front_End.git

In the folder Front_End open git bash, run command: yarn install. 
Then run: yarn start.

Navigate to the dad-jokes folder, run command: yarn install.
Then run: yarn start.

Its pretty simple functionally but its got most of the stuff we intended to use for the front in side. Let me know what you guys think.
